# SpaceInvaders--OnlineCourseProject
my first python project in my journey to master python and pygame,the project is essentially a project that was given in the course Pygame tutorial for beginners(FreeCodeCamp.org):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
the code is a little modification to the original code so nothing really to brag about but overall it was a nice learning experince
